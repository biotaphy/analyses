Description
===========

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) [#f1]_ is a text-based data format designed
to be easy for humans and machines to read and understand.  It has a simple
schema of objects, arrays, and values that can be nested.  It is compatible
with a Python dictionary. 

Example
=======

 ::
    {
      "key1" : "value 1",
      "my_array" : [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "my_obj" : {
        "another key" : "Sub object key"
      }
    }
